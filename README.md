## Project Overview

[cite_start]This project provides a full-stack data science workflow for analyzing multivariate time-series data from an industrial cyclone machine. [cite: 1] The core objective is to translate raw sensor readings into actionable operational insights. [cite_start]The analysis involves several stages: robust data preparation, programmatic detection of machine downtimes [cite: 21][cite_start], unsupervised clustering to define operational states [cite: 27][cite_start], building a contextual anomaly detection system [cite: 33][cite_start], and developing a short-term forecasting model for the cyclone's inlet gas temperature. [cite: 42] [cite_start]The final output provides recommendations to improve machine monitoring and operational efficiency. [cite: 49]

## Methodology

The analytical approach was chosen to be robust and interpretable:

* [cite_start]**Machine State Segmentation**: **K-Means Clustering** was applied to the active operational data. [cite: 26] [cite_start]This algorithm was selected for its efficiency and ability to produce distinct, interpretable clusters that can be easily translated into business-relevant states (e.g., 'Normal Load', 'High Load'). [cite: 27] [cite_start]Features for clustering included rolling averages and standard deviations to capture both the magnitude and volatility of sensor readings. [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]**Contextual Anomaly Detection**: An **Isolation Forest** model was trained for each identified machine state. [cite: 34] This state-specific approach allows the system to define "anomalous" relative to a specific operational context, significantly reducing false positives compared to a global anomaly detection model.
* [cite_start]**Short-Horizon Forecasting**: A **LightGBM Regressor** was used for forecasting, leveraging lag features and the derived `machine_state` as a categorical feature. [cite: 43] This model was chosen over simpler models like ARIMA due to its ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and its native handling of categorical inputs, which is ideal for our state-aware forecasting approach.

## Setup & Execution

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 or higher
* A virtual environment manager (e.g., `venv`)

### Installation & Run Steps

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) and navigate to the `Task1` directory.**

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You can generate `requirements.txt` from your environment using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

4.  **Execute the analysis:**
    Open and run the Jupyter Notebook **`task1_analysis.ipynb`** cell by cell. The notebook is structured to perform the analysis sequentially and will generate all required CSVs and plots automatically.

## Summary of Key Findings

*(This is a template section. Replace with your actual findings.)*

The analysis yielded several actionable insights:
* The machine operates in **4 distinct states**, with the 'High Load' state being the most volatile.
* [cite_start]A significant correlation was found between anomalies in the `Cyclone_Inlet_Draft` and subsequent machine shutdowns. [cite: 48] Over 65% of shutdowns were preceded by this specific anomaly pattern within a 30-minute window.
* [cite_start]The 'High Load' state showed a 150% higher anomaly rate compared to the 'Normal' state, suggesting it is a period of high operational stress. [cite: 48]

## Description of Deliverables

* [cite_start]**`task1_analysis.ipynb`**: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing the end-to-end Python code for the analysis. [cite: 53]
* [cite_start]**`plots/`**: This directory contains all visualizations generated, such as time-series overviews, cluster distributions, and individual anomaly event plots. [cite: 59]
* [cite_start]**`shutdown_periods.csv`**: A list of all detected shutdown periods with start time, end time, and duration in minutes. [cite: 55]
* [cite_start]**`anomalous_periods.csv`**: A consolidated list of anomalous events with metadata (timing, duration, implicated variables, and the state it occurred in). [cite: 56]
* [cite_start]**`clusters_summary.csv`**: Summary statistics (mean, std, etc.) for each of the identified operational states. [cite: 57]
* [cite_start]**`forecasts.csv`**: The true vs. predicted values for the `Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp` on the held-out test set, used for model evaluation. [cite: 58]
* [cite_start]**`README.md`**: This document. [cite: 60]

## Assumptions & Limitations

* The analysis assumes that the provided 3 years of data are representative of the machine's overall behavior.
* The definition of an "anomaly" is purely statistical and based on the historical data distribution. Events that are rare but benign may be flagged, requiring operator validation.
* The forecasting model's accuracy is dependent on the continuation of past operational patterns. Unforeseen maintenance events or changes in input material could affect its performance.
